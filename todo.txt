todo:

* Look into other generation algorithms
* Fix logic in cycle count calculation with (only) step back animation function. 1 extra frame being played
* Implement error checking for settings and generally improve them

Done:

* Comment animation code
* Change it so solve maze resets animation (same as new maze).
* general once over of the controller code.
* Fix highlight bug with undoing first solution placement.
* Fix bug where going back at the end and hitting play resets the animation
* Add functionality for drop downs
* Implement animation speed.
* Debug Dijkstra (Was offering current element back into PQ rather than the adjacent)
* Implement settings
* Add BFS and Dijkstra
* Implement resizing code
* Implement base speed change in settings
* Debug Dijkstra
